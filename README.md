# Minor Project On LIVE FACE-DETECTION
Repo Holds the Minor project that I built for my Semester Exams.


# Introduction: 
A face detection system is a computer application for automatically detecting human face from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. Face detection is a pre-processing of face recognition. It is also used for the security system.

# Overview
The face is our primary focus of attention in social life playing an important role in conveying identity and emotions. We can recognize a number of faces learned throughout our lifespan and identify faces at a glance even after years of separation. This skill is quite robust despite of large variations in visual stimulus due to changing condition, aging and distractions such as beard, glasses or changes in hairstyle. 

Human-robot interaction receives an increasing attention among the researches in different areas of interest during last years. In the current project we address one of the computer vision tasks, involved in developing of such an interactive system. Namely, we are interested in detecting human user presence and tracking of his attention.
Detecting human faces in a video is a great challenging problem. These configurations may be like angle of view, background intensity, and various illuminations. This is due to high variety of configurations that may occur. The complexness of the face results in a particular degree of issue for fast detection and tracking.
For face detection and tracking in a given video sequence different algorithms have been introduced over the past few years. Each algorithm has got its own advantages and disadvantages. But any face tracking algorithm will have some errors which will cause deviation from the required object. The tracker can be accurate if and only if it is able to minimize this deviation. The technique used in this report is one of the effective approaches. It is quicker and simpler and we make use of the eigen vectors for detecting the faces along with the superficial points of our faces.
Object detection and tracking are important in many computer vision applications including activity recognition, automotive safety, and surveillance. In this example, you will develop a simple face tracking system by dividing the tracking problem into three parts:
1. Detect a face
2. Facial features to track
3. Track the face
